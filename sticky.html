    <p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design webpages. Here are some key points about HTML:

        Structure: HTML consists of a series of elements, represented by tags, that define different parts of a webpage.
    </p>

    <img src="Images/emoji.png" class="emoji" alt="emoji-icon" 
    class="img.emoji"
    />

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML 
            (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
        </p>

     <img src="Images/emoji.png" class="emoji" alt="emoji-icon" 
     class="img.emoji"
     />


        <P>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, 
             since the content can be written without concern for its presentation.
